# Java Small

This repository contains small Java projects and guides for beginners.

There are three markdown files that will lead you thru a series of
steps to learn some beginner Java programming.

You will use `jshell` to learn about variables, methods, and classes.
**Make sure you TYPE the snippets from the markdown files into `jshell`**.
Not typing, doing copy/paste, will not help you learn (and is cheating at this point of the course)

## Learning Path

Use a browser to be able to see the markdown files.
Start with `JavaSmall.md` and follow the links to the other guides:

1. **JavaSmall.md** - Learn Java basics with the interpreter
2. **VARS.md** - Understanding Java variables and types
3. **ClassPerson.md** - Creating and using Java classes

## Tips for Success

1. **Type, don't copy-paste** - Build muscle memory
2. **Experiment freely** - Java interpreter (jshell) is forgiving
3. **Use meaningful variable names** - Java encourages readability
4. **Pay attention to indentation** - Java uses whitespace to keep things clean
5. **Read error messages** - Jshell error messages are helpful


## File Extensions

It's weird. When using jshell, you use one file extension, when using `javac` (the Java compiler) you a different one.

- **Jshell files**: `.jsh`
- **Java files**: Must be saved as `.java` files
